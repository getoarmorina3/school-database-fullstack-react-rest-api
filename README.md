# School Database Fullstack React REST API
 
In this project, I utilized React to develop a client for my pre-existing school database REST API. The full-stack application facilitates users in administering a school database, encompassing information about courses. Users can engage with the database by retrieving a list of courses, viewing details for a specific course, as well as creating, updating, and deleting courses in the database.

To accomplish this project, I leveraged my expertise in React, JSX, React Router, React Context API, and Create React App.

To run this project, follow the steps below:

- Navigate to the `api` folder in your terminal.
- Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
- Execute `npm run seed` to seed the database.
- Start the server by running `node app.js`. The server will run on port 5000.

Next, open a new terminal window:

- Go to the `client` folder.
- Run `npm install` to install the necessary client-side dependencies.
- Start the client application with `npm run start`.
